# QMB6358-iris
A collection of small datasets to practice data handling.

## Background

These data were collected to revisit the analysis of iris flowers, 
following the seminal work of E. Anderson and R. A. Fisher. 
The dataset was updated by measuring the dimensions of the flower petals to a higher degree of accuracy and by collecting several samples.
